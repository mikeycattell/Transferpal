    <p><br><strong>GOV.UK Report Benefit Fraud</strong></p>
    <p class="font24" style="padding-top: 60px;">Making a landing page interesting and catchy is as important as its being informative and clear. Today’s case study shares the design flow of creating a bright landing page for a company with a diversity of services it offers to its clients. Tubik designer Ludmila Shevchenko shares now only the stages of the project but also useful tips for designers.</a></p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 600;">Process</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The given design is a landing page of the agency website. The task was to create a unique, totally new vision of the service for the client. The website had to stand out from the similar ones, be noticeable and remarkable for a user. Inspired with the task, based on user research and market exploration, the designer decided to solve this task using color and shapes, searching for the perfect combination of this methods.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 600;">Sketching and Wireframing</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The work started from UX wireframing when the straightforward structure has been chosen. Here the designer worked out the structure of several sections each devoted to diverse offers. Having each section as a new page, we gain the experience where user attention is concentrated specifically on the information of that section. Ludmila mentions that for her, even when the overall structure doesn’t have a lot of elements, it’s still easier to make first steps by sketching on paper. The connection of the ideas and instant hand moves can bring to the new ways of representation and composition. While you’re sketching your first vision, the new idea comes to your mind. So, she believes that sketching in the classic old-fashioned way is the best way to blow up creativity.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>After shaping the idea on paper and structuring it in mind, she draws the UX in Sketch. Depending on the task, the first explorations can be shown to the client whether in hand-drawn sketches or digital wireframes as it happened in this case.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 600;">Design</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Next, she started to work on UI design. As the first part of the page had only the company name, slogan and arrow inviting to scroll, the idea was to create a bright and engaging background. The designer started to create the abstract combination of elements keeping in mind that it can be further animated. First variants were strict figures like rectangles and squares but then she came up with the idea that rounded shapes would look more friendly. As a result, they symbolize the mystery behind the imaginary scenes that the user was invited to discover. Having a slight movement we added liveliness to the page.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 600;">Bonus: Designer’s Tips on Boosting Skills</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The Tubik designers are often asked to share some ideas and tips about boosting professional level and productivity of the creative process. Ludmila shares the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, you should train your taste watching the examples of design in all spheres, following not only mobile, web designers and companies but also the influencers in such spheres as graphic design, architecture, photography, and art. This way you will always know what directions are on top right now, what ideas are trendy and catchy.</li><br>
      <li>Next, you can challenge yourself creating some small tasks that you will make when you have a spare time between work. It’s about creating concepts or solving the issues on current themes.</li><br>
      <li>There always exist the basic topics you can enhance such as typography, composition, color or when it comes to the other side — self-development and work process improvement.</li><br>
      <li>One of the books the designer would really like to recommend is “Interaction of Color” by Josef Albers: it shares the color studies, principles and even illusions you can create using color.</li>
